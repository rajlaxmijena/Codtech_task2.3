Project Name : End to end data science project -Insurance Pricing Forecast

End-to-End Data Science Project: Insurance Pricing Forecast involves predicting insurance premiums based on historical data and risk factors.

Key Steps: Problem Definition: Predict future insurance premiums based on customer profiles and claims history. Data Collection: Gather data (e.g., customer demographics, claim history, vehicle info). Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, encode categorical data, scale numerical data. Feature Engineering: Create new features (e.g., claim frequency, claim amount ratio). Model Selection: Use models like Linear Regression, Random Forest, or XGBoost. Training: Split data into training and test sets, train the model, and tune hyperparameters. Evaluation: Use metrics like RMSE and MAE to measure performance. Deployment: Deploy the model via a REST API or cloud platform. Example: Input: Customer age, vehicle type, claim history Output: Predicted insurance premium Model: Gradient Boosting Benefits: ✅ Improves pricing accuracy ✅ Reduces risk of under/overcharging ✅ Enhances customer satisfaction
